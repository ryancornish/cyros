 * restore. No kernel internals are touched, so these tests survive internal
 * refactors (kernel_state consolidation included).
 *
 * Failure modes are engineered to be assertions, not hangs, wherever the
 * physics allows: every conductor poll has a bounded budget and a bail path
 * that releases all gates so the system can quiesce and the recorded failure
 * flag can be asserted in the test body. The one exception is a genuinely
 * broken transfer (a lost wakeup), which can only manifest as a hang, and the
 * framework timeout is the correct detector for that.
 *
 * Choreography discipline (preempt port, no slice timer): every spin gate
 * waits on a value set from a DIFFERENT core, every same-core dependency is a
 * real block, and each cross-thread stage is sequenced so no thread spins on
 * a peer that cannot run. Priorities are chosen so witnesses run exactly when
 * their subject has vacated the core.

 * under strict priority scheduling WITHOUT inheritance would preempt L (3
 * beats 5) the moment it becomes ready and starve the lock holder forever,
 * leaving H blocked behind a holder that never runs: unbounded inversion.
 * With inheritance, L runs at H's priority 1 for the whole critical section,
 * Mid (3) cannot preempt it, and the chain drains promptly.
 *
 * Observed three ways per rep:
 *   1. Donation: the conductor polls L's public priority to 1 after H parks.
 *   2. Prevention: Mid is made ready mid-CS (its gate is released and a grace
 *      window is burned) yet mid_started stays false until L exits the CS.
 *   3. Restore: H, which runs strictly after L's release recompute, reads L
 *      back at base priority 5.

 * to schedule each actor) which also exercises transfer on a second and third
