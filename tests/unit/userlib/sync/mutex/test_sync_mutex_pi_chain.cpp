/**
 * @file test_sync_mutex_pi_chain.cpp
 * @brief Deep transitive priority-inheritance chains, parameterised on depth.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Every other PI test tops out at a chain of depth 2, which is the shallowest
 * shape that is transitive at all. Two consequences that this file addresses:
 *
 * 1. The transitive chase has been broken for as long as it has existed, and it
 *    survived precisely because almost nothing exercised it. Depth 2 once per
 *    test run is not pressure.
 * 2. The cost of evaluating a thread's urgency is bounded by chain DEPTH, and
 *    depth is the one quantity the substrate stage 2 probe could not measure,
 *    because it only ever saw flat folds. See pi-derived-urgency-proposal.md
 *    section 11b.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-08-06, AGAINST THE OLD PUSH DESIGN (HISTORICAL)
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * These numbers predate derived urgency and describe a mechanism that has since
 * been deleted, including the transitive bug they were taken to characterise.
 * Kept because the LATENCY shape is the interesting part. RE-MEASURED against
 * the fold on 2026-09-18 (Arch box, cross-core-defects.md 8.2b): 0 failures in
 * 1000 rounds and min = mean = 1 spin at every depth. Read that carefully, it is
 * flat partly BY CONSTRUCTION: get_priority() now folds on read, so the first
 * poll after the donor parks already sees the donation, and there is no
 * cross-core propagation left for this curve to measure. The cost moved into
 * the fold itself, which DISABLED_..._ReportFoldCost prices.
 *
 *   depth curve, 200 rounds per depth, 1000 rounds total in 3.5 seconds:
 *
 *       depth | fail% | min spins | mean spins
 *           2 |  0.5% |         1 |        913
 *           3 |  0.0% |         1 |       1145
 *           4 |  0.5% |        12 |       1652
 *           5 |  0.0% |       208 |       2121
 *           6 |  0.5% |       605 |       3260
 *
 *       Two things fall out. Propagation LATENCY grows with depth, and the min
 *       column is the clean signal because it is the floor with scheduling
 *       variance removed: 1, 1, 12, 208, 605. That is what a serialised chain of
 *       cross-core doorbells predicts, one reschedule round trip per link.
 *
 *       Failure RATE does not grow with depth: flat at about 0.3 percent overall
 *       and unrelated to chain length. So the transitive bug is a timing window
 *       at a single link, not risk accumulating over links.
 *   repeated depth-3 (50 rounds per run): fails about 1 round in 250, showing
 *       up in roughly 8 runs out of 40.
 *
 * So the known transitive bug IS reproduced here, but at ~0.4 percent per round
 * against ~14 percent per run for the hand-written depth-2 test in
 * test_sync_mutex_pi.cpp. That test remains the better trigger.
 *
 * The likely reason, and it is worth knowing before extending this file: every
 * gate below is a semaphore, so the chain is strictly ordered and fully blocked
 * before the donor parks. The failing window in the real bug is a thread that is
 * ARMED but NOT YET BLOCKED, which clean sequencing largely avoids. A future
 * variant that has the donor park CONCURRENTLY with a mid-chain thread blocking
 * would attack that window directly, and is the obvious next iteration.
 *
 * ENABLED 2026-08-09
 * -------------------
 * The two assertion tests ran DISABLED for as long as the transitive chase was
 * broken, because a permanently red suite destroys the thing every conclusion in
 * that investigation depended on: being able to run a few hundred iterations and
 * read the result. That bug is closed, and not by fixing the chase but by
 * deleting it, see sync-mutex-pi-plan.md section 0. Re-enabling them was the
 * documented completion bar.
 *
 * Evidence for enabling, laptop, at the commit that closed it:
 *   filtered to these tests   0 failures / 40 runs
 *   full binary               0 chain failures / ~150 runs
 * against a recorded baseline of roughly 8 runs in 40 for the repeated depth-3
 * test alone.
 *
 * The COST CURVE test stays disabled, and not because it is flaky. It reports
 * rather than asserts, the number being the deliverable, and 200 rounds across
 * five depths does not belong in a suite people run in a loop. Run it
 * deliberately:
 *   ./test_sync_mutex --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests --gtest_filter='*CostCurve*'
 *
 * Be aware it has produced a genuine KERNEL PANIC once in 40 runs, a signal-mask
 * mismatch at port_linux_preempt.cpp:430, which is a PORT defect this file
 * merely stresses rather than anything about chaining. Worth knowing before you
 * blame the chain code for it.
 *
 * THE SHAPE
 * ---------
 * For depth D, holder[i] owns mutex[i], and holder[i] for i >= 1 then blocks on
 * mutex[i-1]. An urgent thread finally blocks on mutex[D-1]. So one donation at
 * the top must chase D links to reach holder[0]:
 *
 *   urgent -> holder[D-1] -> holder[D-2] -> ... -> holder[0]
 *
 * Holders are spread round-robin across cores so most links are cross-core,
 * which is the case the propagation actually has to survive.

    * OWN base priority, so m[6] had no waiter at all. A fold that had merely
    * failed to cross an armed queue would have read 5, holder[7]'s base.

 * What one urgency fold costs, as a function of chain depth
 *
 * The pick used to be a bitmap scan. It is now a bitmap scan plus, for every
 * holder ready on that core, a fold that can take a queue spinlock and recurse
 * once per link, all inside the retire-and-pick critical section with local
 * interrupts disabled. cross-core-defects.md 8.2 states that bound. This
 * measures it, because principle 5 asks for a number and a stated bound is not
 * a measured one.
 *
 * Reports two columns. FLAT is a thread holding nothing, which is the fast path
 * and 98.9 percent of picks. DEEP is the chain's deepest holder, whose fold
 * walks every link and is the worst case the depth budget permits.
 *
 * Measured with the whole chain parked, so the locks are UNCONTENDED. That is
 * the floor, not the ceiling: a fold racing other cores on the same queues pays
 * more. Report it as such.
 *
 * Measurement only, no assertion, so it stays disabled and is run deliberately:
 *   ./test_sync_mutex --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests --gtest_filter='*FoldCost*'
