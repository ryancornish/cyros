/* ============================================================================
 * Priority inheritance: the machinery derived urgency introduced
 *
 * The other PI files observe that a holder's REPORTED priority changes. These
 * two observe things that only exist because urgency is computed at the pick
 * rather than cached and propagated, and that nothing else covers:
 *
 *   1. The pick itself. A boosted holder is no longer filed in the ready matrix
 *      under a boosted key, because the matrix is keyed on base priority and
 *      nothing re-keys it. It sits on its core's holder list and the pick folds
 *      urgency over that list to decide. So "the right thread runs" is now a
 *      DIFFERENT property from "get_priority reports the right number", and
 *      only the first one is what users experience. This test observes which
 *      thread actually runs.
 *
 *   2. Bridge overflow. A queue folds urgency over the waiters that themselves
 *      hold something, and snapshots a bounded number of them. Past that bound
 *      it deliberately reports maximum urgency, over-boosting the holder,
 *      because the alternative is under-reporting and unbounded inversion. That
 *      is a silent degradation path: nothing else in the suite reaches it, and
 *      if it inverted no existing test would notice.
 *
 *   3. Ties. A holder's urgency can land exactly on the matrix's best base
 *      priority, and the two live in different structures with no arrival order
 *      between them. Whichever side loses a tie is not advanced by losing, so it
 *      loses the next one identically: a fixed policy is indefinite starvation,
 *      not unfairness. Two tests, one per structure boundary.
 *
 * Same discipline as the sibling files: black box through lock/unlock and
 * get_priority, bounded polls with a bail path so a failure is an assertion
 * rather than a hang, and every spin gate waits on a value set from a
 * different core.

/* ============================================================================
 * The prompt walk must not stop at a waiter that is not parked yet
 *
 * Same chain as the sibling test above: A -> m2 (held by B) -> B -> m1 (held
 * by C) -> C, with a spinner N on C's core that only urgency 1 beats. The
 * sibling parks B before A donates, so the walk always meets B blocked. This
 * one aims A's donation at the window between B arming on m1 and B parking.
 * In that window B is still running, or already rotated out READY by a
 * preemption with blocked_on still published, and it stays ready for as long
 * as a better thread wants its core. A donation arriving then must still walk
 * through B to C. B cannot pass it on itself once its own donate has run, it
 * will not run again to repeat it, and C's core has no tick to save it.
 *
 * Two independent hitters sweep that window from the b_locking anchor B
 * publishes just before locking. A jitters its own donation so its walk reads
 * B mid-window while B is running-and-armed. The driver jitters the release
 * of P, base 0 on B's core, whose wake IPI preempts B mid-window and holds it
 * off the core, so a later walk reads B ready-and-armed. The window is
 * microseconds wide and the anchor-to-hit latencies are comparable, so not
 * every round catches it. Rounds that miss degenerate to the sibling's
 * blocked-B case and still assert the walk worked.
 *
 * The bail path is two-staged for a reason. If C never resumes, the driver
 * first stops P alone and polls again. A round where B was preempted before
 * its own donate ran self-heals here, because the resumed B finishes its
 * acquire poll and prompts C itself, and that is a pass. A round where the
 * walk genuinely stopped at a not-yet-blocked B does not self-heal, B just
 * parks, and only then is the failure recorded. That distinction is what
 * makes a red run diagnostic: C reporting urgency 1 at the failure means the
 * fold computed the transitive boost and nothing delivered the prompt.

/* ============================================================================
 * A ceiling boosts on an UNCONTENDED acquire, which is the whole difference

 * Inheritance cannot do this. It has nothing to inherit from until a waiter

 * raises the holder the moment it takes the lock, so the thread that would have
 * caused the inversion never gets to run in the critical section at all.
 *
 * The observation is deliberately of the SAME shape as the busy-spinner tests
 * above, so the two protocols can be read side by side:
 *
 *   H, base 5 on core0, takes a cemutex with ceiling 2 and never contends
 *   N, base 3 on core0, a CPU-bound spinner released once H holds the lock
 *
 * With inheritance H sits at 5, N at 3 wins every pick, and H does not run
 * again until N stops. With the ceiling H is at 2 from the moment it acquires,
 * so N cannot take the core at all while the lock is held. No third thread and
 * no waiter is involved, which is the point: nothing donates anything here.
 *
 * The release half is asserted too, and it is the part most likely to regress.
 * A ceiling release drops urgency with no waiter to wake, so nothing pends a
 * reschedule unless the release does it explicitly. Without that prompt N stays
 * ready behind a thread that is no longer boosted, on a tickless build, forever.

/* ============================================================================
 * A ceiling lock must not CUT a transitive chain that passes through it
 *
 * The sibling test above proves a ceiling boosts its holder with no waiter
 * present. This one asks the harder question: what does a ceiling lock
 * contribute when the thread waiting on it is itself boosted from somewhere
 * else?
 *
 * Chain: U -> M (held by W) -> W -> C (held by H) -> H, where C is a cemutex
 * and M is an ordinary inheritance mutex.
 *
 *   H  base 5, core0   holds C, ceiling 2
 *   X  base 1, core0   CPU-bound, never blocks, released on cue
 *   W  base 4, core1   holds M, then parks on C, so it is a BRIDGE on C's queue
 *   U  base 0, core2   parks on M, lifting W to urgency 0
 *
 * The two candidate answers for H's urgency differ, and X sits between them:
 *
 *   contribution = ceiling                  -> H is 2, and X at 1 preempts it
 *   contribution = min(ceiling, queue top)  -> H is 0, and X cannot
 *
 * Note what the ceiling contract can and cannot see here. It requires the
 * ceiling to be at least as urgent as every thread that LOCKS the resource,
 * and both lockers satisfy it, 2 <= 4 and 2 <= 5. U is the thread whose
 * urgency goes missing and U never touches C at all, so no assert on any
 * acquire path is a party to this. That is why it has to be a test.
 *
 * The observation is deliberately the negative one, X failing to run, so the
 * control matters: after H releases, X MUST run. Otherwise "X never ran" could
 * mean the wake was simply lost and the test would be vacuous. Stage 5 catches
 * that.
 *
 * Every gate is set from a different core than the thread waiting on it, and H
 * holds its core until the driver releases it rather than terminating, because
 * thread teardown reschedules and would hand X the core for free. That is the
 * lesson the sibling test above paid for.
