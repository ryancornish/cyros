/* ============================================================================
 * What this suite tests, and how it observes it
 *
 * sync::mutex is the productionised form of the transfer resource proven in
 * test_transfer_waitables: try_lock() is a non-blocking CAS take, lock() parks
 * on the mutex via wait_on, and unlock() is wake_one_and_transfer, which is
 * what makes the mutex barge-free (ownership is committed to the woken waiter
 * under the queue lock, so no fresh try_lock can interpose). The transfer test
 * already stresses that mechanism at the waitable level, so this suite is the
 * lighter, mutex-level wiring check: it drives ONLY the public surface
 * (try_lock / lock / unlock) and never reads the private owner field. Every
 * property below is inferred from observable behaviour instead:
 *   - try_lock()'s bool result,
 *   - an atomic in-critical-section occupancy sentinel,
 *   - the ORDER in which threads return from lock().
 *
 * The timed acquire paths (try_lock_for / try_lock_until) are intentionally
 * NOT exercised: they are not linked in this build.
 *
 * Shared state lives in a per-test struct captured by a single reference. That
 * keeps each thread entry closure to one pointer (thread::entry_fn has a fixed
 * 48-byte inline buffer and hard-errors on overflow) and names every field the
 * threads coordinate through.
 *
 * Latency note
 * ------------
 * On the preempt backend the dominant cost is the number of full kernel
 * lifecycles: every kernel::start() at cores == 4 spawns and joins three
 * per-core pthreads and installs their signal interceptors. So the heavy
 * mutual-exclusion stress below runs many thousands of contended rounds
 * INSIDE a handful of lifecycles (the round_robin model) rather than one race
 * per lifecycle repeated hundreds of times. The race-sensitive handoff tests
 * do need a fresh setup per window, so they keep a MODEST rep count rather
 * than the transfer suite's 200.
 *
 * Preempt-without-a-timer discipline
 * ----------------------------------
 * This suite starts no slice timer, so two equal-priority threads on the same
 * core never rotate. Consequently no thread here busy-spins on a flag that
 * only a same-core equal-priority peer can set (that would wedge). Every spin
 * gate waits on a flag set from a DIFFERENT core (resolves in microseconds on
 * genuinely parallel pthreads), and every same-core dependency is expressed as
 * a real lock() block, which voluntarily yields the core. The witness threads
 * that detect "a waiter has parked" are strictly lower priority on the
 * waiter's own core, so strict priority scheduling only lets them run once the
 * waiter has actually blocked in lock().
 * ========================================================================= */

 * Mutual exclusion under cross-core contention (the flagship)
 *
 * The property the whole primitive exists for: no two threads are ever inside
 * the critical section at once. Four workers, one pinned per core, each loop
 * lock / critical-section / unlock for many rounds, all fighting over a single
 * mutex. Detection is twofold:
 *
 *   1. occupancy sentinel (well-defined): on entry a worker fetch_adds an
 *      atomic counter and asserts the PRIOR value was 0. If it ever sees a
 *      non-zero prior, two owners were live simultaneously. This check is
 *      race-free regardless of whether the mutex is correct.
 *
 *   2. shared_counter (deliberately NON-atomic): incremented only inside the
 *      critical section. Under a correct mutex every access is serialised by
 *      the lock, so there is no data race and the final value must equal the
 *      total number of rounds. A broken mutex that admitted two owners would
 *      race this counter (undefined behaviour, yes, but that race IS the bug
 *      being hunted) and typically drop updates, surfacing as a short count.
 *
 * All the intensity lives in contention_rounds, INSIDE each lifecycle, so this
 * stays cheap on the preempt backend no matter how hard we crank it. A worker
 * that cannot get the lock parks (a real yield), so there is no same-core spin
 * to wedge, and unlock's transfer wakes a parked peer on another core via the
 * IPI path.
