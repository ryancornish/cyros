/* ============================================================================
 * Mutex contention under a timer storm
 *
 * This binary exists because of a hole in the suite rather than a hypothesis
 * about a bug. Every sync test in the tree builds `time_driver = "tickless"`,
 * so it has no tick at all, and every timer test builds without the `sync`
 * feature. The result is that the mutex, priority-inheritance and scheduler
 * machinery had never once run with a timer ISR firing underneath it. This is
 * the first build that combines the two.
 *
 * What that combination is worth exercising for, in the order it matters:
 *
 *   1. The port's signal masking. Interrupt-disable and preempt-disable are one
 *      signal mask on this port, and the model that keeps them straight is
 *      sensitive to how often signals actually arrive. A tick raises the
 *      delivery rate by orders of magnitude over anything else in the suite,
 *      which is the condition its assert has always been most likely to fire
 *      under. See preempt-port-masking-explained.md.
 *
 *   2. An ISR waking a HOLDER, which is the path cross-core-defects.md 8.2
 *      argues is sound and nothing executes. wake_one is documented ISR-safe,
 *      and it reaches set_thread_ready, which folds the woken thread's urgency
 *      and can therefore take remote queue spinlocks with local interrupts
 *      disabled, recursing to the inheritance depth bound. Core 3's worker
 *      blocks on a semaphore WHILE HOLDING a contended mutex, and its own
 *      core's timer ISR is what releases it, so every tick on core 3 drives
 *      that fold from interrupt context.
 *
 *   3. Bring-up and shutdown. Ticks arriving across the dormant-region
 *      transitions, which are depth changes on the same mask, and which a
 *      single long-running test would never sample. Hence several lifecycles.
 *
 *   4. A tick landing INSIDE a reschedule. The interceptor passes no
 *      block_extra, so the timer is deliverable through the interception and
 *      preempts the kernel's reschedule the way an IRQ preempts PendSV.
 *
 * The assertions here are deliberately weak, because the value is in the soak
 * rather than in any one run. A run that neither trips an assert nor hangs is
 * the result, and the checks below exist mostly to stop a run that did nothing
 * from looking like a run that survived something. The tick counters are the
 * vacuity guard: if the storm did not fire, the test failed to test anything
 * and says so rather than passing quietly.
 *
 * Lock order is m_outer then m_inner everywhere it is nested, so nothing here
 * can deadlock on its own. Each core carries exactly one thread, so the port's
 * no-slice-timer starvation rule (a same-core non-yielding spinner deadlocks)
 * cannot bite either.
