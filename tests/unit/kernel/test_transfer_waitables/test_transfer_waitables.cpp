 * Deliberately mirrors the shape a real priority_mutex would use: a single
 * atomic owner id, 0 meaning free, taken by CAS when uncontended and passed
 * by ownership on release when contended. is_satisfied() recognises BOTH the
 * uncontended take and "ownership was already transferred to me while parked",
 * which is what lets a wake_one_and_transfer-released resource still compose with
 * wait_on / wait_on_any.
 *
 * release() exposes wake_one_and_transfer() directly (protected in waitable) so test
 * threads can drive it without protected access.
