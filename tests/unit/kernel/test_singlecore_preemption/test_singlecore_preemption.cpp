/**
 * @file test_singlecore_preemption.cpp
 * @brief Single-core preemption tests for the linux_preempt port.
 *
 * These exercise the property the cooperative boost port structurally cannot
 * reach: an asynchronous signal interrupting a running thread mid-loop and
 * forcing a context switch. Two equal-priority threads are pinned to core0 and
 * neither yields. On a cooperative port the first would run to completion before
 * the second ever started. Here an external interrupt source preempts them, so
 * they interleave.
 *
 * The interrupt source is a plain std::thread that fires the port's reschedule
 * IPI at core0. That stands in for the timer port, which does not exist yet.
 *
 * Lifecycle care
 * --------------
 * A reschedule signal delivered after the kernel has shut down would land on a
 * core whose reschedule handler has been cleared, which is undefined. So the
 * helper must be provably stopped before shutdown can run. The interleaving test
 * below arranges that the helper fires only while both workers are still
 * spinning, and the same flag that stops the helper is the one that releases the
 * workers. Every IPI therefore happens while both workers are alive, which means
 * the kernel cannot have quiesced and the cores are still valid. Once the flag
 * flips, teardown is driven entirely by thread_exit's own self-signal, so there
 * is no liveness dependence on the helper either.
