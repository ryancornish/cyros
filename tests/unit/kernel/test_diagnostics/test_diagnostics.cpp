/**
 * @file test_diagnostics.cpp
 * @brief The blocking-chain query on live, resolvable chains.
 *
 * Every chain built here resolves and every thread terminates, so the suite
 * ends by quiescing normally. The wait-for CYCLE case cannot be tested that
 * way, a deadlocked thread never exits, so it lives in its own binary
 * (test_diagnostics_deadlock) that ends the process explicitly.
 *
 * Single core. The interleaving is driven by priorities and semaphore gates:
 * a release of a more urgent thread preempts the releaser at its next
 * scheduling point, which is how each thread is walked into position.
