 * a level, not an event to consume: once fired, any thread that waits on this
 * alarm is satisfied until it is re-armed. That is what makes a fire that lands
 * before the waiter parks harmless, the pre-park poll sees it.
 *
 * Composes with the group wait: wait_on_any(thing, alarm) is a timed wait on
 * the thing, and which index comes back says whether it was the deadline.
 *
 * @note Arm and destroy on the same thread. The timer callback runs on the
 *       arming core, so a same-thread disarm or destroy cannot race it. There
 *       is deliberately no support for destroying an armed alarm from another
 *       thread.
