/**
 * @brief Mutual exclusion with priority inheritance.
 *
 * A zero-cost facade over the kernel's base_mutex, which is where the type has
 * to live because the scheduler folds it at every pick. This header is the one
 * users include, so every synchronisation primitive stays grouped here.
 *
 * Naming the protocol at the declaration is the point: a future ceiling_mutex is
 * a sibling facade over the same base, so which inversion protocol a lock runs
 * is visible where the lock is declared rather than in a config flag. See
 * mutex-first-class-plan.md D6.
 *
 * Not a waitable, so it cannot enter a wait_on_any group. That ban is structural
 * and deliberate, see base_mutex.
