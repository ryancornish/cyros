/**
 * @file port.h
 * @brief Cyros Port Layer API (C ABI)
 *
 * This is the main* contract between the kernel component, and the hardware/platform.
 * Code that implements this contract's API for a specific platforms architecture is
 * a 'port implementation'. A port implementation must implemented definitions for ALL
 * functions declared here.
 *
 * The API uses C linkage for a _simpler_ ABI. This allows port implemenetations to
 * be in C or assembly. Though C++ is still available.
 *
 * *This is the _main_ contract, but not the only port contract. More specifically,
 * this is the contract between the kernel component of Cyros and the platform.
 * It is the bare-minimum implementable for a complete Cyros build. Other components
 * such as the time-driver also require a port implementation. If the Cyros build requires
 * a time-driver, then it also requires the port component to implement it. The contract
 * for the time driver is separate-but-parallel to this contract (see port_time.h).

 *    still permitting ISRs to run.
 * A context switch on a core can occur only when BOTH are at zero depth:
 * interrupts unmasked and preemption enabled. That joint condition is what
 * port.h refers to as "baseline priority".
 *
 * The port owns the preemption mechanism because it is platform-specific
 * (a real priority/mask action on bare metal, a counter on a cooperative
 * simulation port). The kernel owns the policy: it decides when to call
 * these, and with what nesting.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Reschedule Requests
 *
 * Cyros distinguishes TWO reschedule operations. They differ in their
 * preconditions and in the strength of their guarantee. The kernel selects the
 * correct one per call site; a port MUST implement both to this contract.
 *
 * Terminology
 * -----------
 *  - "thread context": executing inside a thread's context, not inside an ISR.
 *  - "kernel-masked": the kernel currently holds a critical section on this
 *    core - interrupts masked via cyros_port_irq_save() AND/OR preemption
 *    disabled via cyros_port_preempt_disable().
 *  - "baseline priority": thread context, with interrupts NOT masked AND
 *    preemption NOT disabled - i.e. both nesting depths at zero. On Cortex-M
 *    this is Thread mode with PRIMASK clear, BASEPRI not raised above the
 *    PendSV priority, and PendSV not otherwise gated.
 *  - "next safe point": the next moment, on this core, at which execution
 *    returns to baseline priority - typically the outermost
 *    cyros_port_irq_restore() or cyros_port_preempt_enable(), or ISR return.
 *
 * Why two operations
 * ------------------
 * A reschedule cannot always be performed at the instant it becomes
 * desirable: the requester may be inside an ISR, or inside a kernel critical
 * section, and in either case switching context immediately would be unsound.
 * Splitting the operation makes the caller's intent - and, importantly, the
 * caller's obligations - explicit at every call site.
 *
 * Summary
 * -------
 *  cyros_port_thread_yield()      strong guarantee, thread context only,
 *                                  baseline priority only, synchronous.
 *  cyros_port_pend_reschedule()   weak guarantee, callable from any context,
 *                                  may be deferred.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/**
 * @brief Yield the calling thread to the scheduler (synchronous reschedule).
 *
 * Strong-guarantee reschedule. The scheduler runs immediately on the calling
 * core; if another thread is selected, the caller is switched out and this
 * call does NOT return until the caller is later switched back in. When it
 * does return, a full reschedule round-trip has provably completed.
 *
 * Precondition - the caller MUST satisfy ALL of:
 *  - Called from thread context (NEVER from an ISR).
 *  - Called at baseline priority: interrupts not masked AND preemption not
 *    disabled.
 *
 * Ports that can observe the execution priority SHOULD assert the baseline
 * precondition inside this function.
 *
 * Use when the caller is deliberately giving up the CPU and depends on the
 * round-trip having completed on return - e.g. blocking in a wait operation,
 * an explicit yield, or a join. Callers MAY rely on post-switch state being
 * valid immediately after this function returns.
 *
 * Port implementation notes:
 *  - Cortex-M: pend PendSV, then DSB/ISB. From baseline priority PendSV is
 *    taken before the next instruction, making the call synchronous.
 *  - RISC-V: trigger the software interrupt (or switch directly); from
 *    baseline priority it is serviced immediately.
 *  - Linux/boost.context: resume the scheduler fiber.
 */
void cyros_port_thread_yield(void);

/**
 * @brief Request a reschedule on the calling core (deferred-safe).
 *
 * Weak-guarantee reschedule. Guarantees ONLY that a reschedule will occur on
 * this core at or before the next safe point. This call MAY return before any
 * context switch has happened.
 *
 * Callable from ANY context: thread context or ISR, with or without a kernel
 * critical section held.
 *
 * Behaviour by context:
 *  - Baseline priority: the next safe point is "now", so the reschedule
 *    resolves before this call returns. This is observationally identical to
 *    cyros_port_thread_yield() - but see the caller obligation below.
 *  - Kernel-masked, or ISR context: the request is recorded and the actual
 *    reschedule is deferred to the next safe point - the outermost
 *    cyros_port_irq_restore() or cyros_port_preempt_enable(), or ISR return.
 *
 * Caller obligation: callers MUST NOT assume that a context switch has
 * occurred, or that any post-switch state is valid, after this call returns.
 * This holds even in the baseline-priority case: the weak guarantee IS the
 * contract, independent of how a particular context happens to satisfy it. A
 * caller that needs the round-trip must use cyros_port_thread_yield().
 *
 * Use when the caller wants to flag that a reschedule may now be warranted but
 * is not itself blocking - e.g. after making a higher-priority thread ready,
 * from a signal/wake path, or from an ISR handing work to a thread.
 *
 * Port implementation notes:
 *  - Cortex-M: set the PendSV pending bit (ICSR.PENDSVSET). The hardware
 *    defers delivery until execution priority drops to the PendSV level.
 *  - RISC-V: set the machine software interrupt pending bit (CLINT MSIP). The
 *    hardware defers delivery until software interrupts are unmasked.
 *  - Linux/boost.context: if at baseline priority, resume the scheduler fiber
 *    now; otherwise set a per-core "reschedule pending" flag that the
 *    irq_restore / preempt_enable safe points (and simulated-ISR return)
 *    check and resolve.
