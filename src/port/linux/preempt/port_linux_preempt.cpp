/**
 * @file port_linux_preempt.cpp
 * @brief Linux simulation port using sigctx for genuine preemptive switching
 *
 * This file implements BOTH halves of the port contract, port_core.h and
 * port_mcu.h. A hosted port has no core/MCU boundary to express: the identity
 * trio is built out of the same file-local state, `global` and the
 * `current_core` TLS, as the switching code, so separating them would publish
 * that state across two translation units for no gain. The ARM tree, where the
 * boundary is real, keeps the two in separate files.
 *
 * Where the boost.context port is cooperative end to end, this port exists to
 * exercise the one path that port structurally cannot reach: an asynchronous
 * signal interrupting a running thread mid-instruction and forcing a context
 * switch out of it. Each pthread still simulates one "core".
 *
 * One road into the scheduler
 * ---------------------------
 * Every reschedule on this port travels through a single signal. The preemption
 * tick (future), the cross-core IPI, the voluntary yield, and the deferred pend
 * all reduce to "make the reschedule signal land". sigctx_intercept captures the
 * interrupted context, hands it to on_reschedule(), and resumes whatever context
 * that handler returns. The handler runs the kernel scheduler, which ends in
 * cyros_port_switch(). That records the context to resume and returns, and the
 * interceptor performs the rt_sigreturn into it. So the kernel's reschedule
 * routine stays a normal call that unwinds, with no hidden non-local exit. The
 * signal handler is the analogue of PendSV running on the handler stack.
 *
 * Synchronous yield (first-step simplification)
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * cyros_port_thread_yield() raises the reschedule signal against itself. At
 * baseline the signal is delivered before pthread_kill() returns, so the yield
 * still gets its strong synchronous round-trip. This pays a signal round-trip
 * per yield. A direct synchronous sigctx swap would be faster and can replace it
 * later once the preemptive path is proven.
 *
 * Masking model
 * -------------
 * Interrupt-disable and preempt-disable gate the SAME reschedule signal here,
 * because the reschedule handler does nothing beyond the switch it is already
 * deferring. So blocking the signal under either depth is correct, and the
 * kernel's pending bit doubles as the deferred-reschedule flag. There is no
 * separate software pending flag.
 *
 * The two depths still mean different things, and the difference becomes visible
 * when the timer port lands. A timer signal will be masked by interrupt-disable
 * (its ISR must not run) and left unmasked by preempt-disable (its ISR runs, and
 * only the switch it requests is deferred). The block helpers below are where a
 * timer signal joins the interrupt path and stays out of the preempt path.
 *
 * The two depths are the state and the OS mask is a derived view of them, so
 * every phase that masks an owned signal, including both signal handlers and the
 * pre-kernel dormant phase, is expressed as a depth. See "Signal mask model"
 * below.
 *
 * Lifetime hazard the whole port turns on
 * ---------------------------------------
 * The captured context the handler receives, and its FP buffer, live on the
 * handler stack that sigctx_intercept carves per invocation. They are valid only
 * for that one handler call. So the outgoing thread's state is relocated into its
 * TCB with sigctx_copy() before any other context is resumed, and the resumed
 * context is always a durable TCB context.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Signal mask model
 *
 * The two depth counters are the state. The OS mask is a DERIVED VIEW of them,
 * recomputed from scratch on every transition and never edited from remembered
 * history. That is what makes it idempotent and independent of the order in which
 * overlapping regions open and close.
 *
 * Why not the usual save/restore token, where a disable returns what it closed and
 * the enable reopens exactly that? Because interrupt- and preempt-disable both
 * gate preempt_signo, so one resource has two candidate owners. Each deferred to
 * the other and neither transferred the obligation, which left the signal blocked
 * with nobody responsible:
 *
 *   irq_save     -> owns the reopen
 *   preempt_disable -> finds it already blocked, so disclaims the reopen
 *   irq_restore  -> declines, correctly, because a preempt region is still live
 *   preempt_enable -> declines, because its token says it never closed it
 *
 * Strict nesting worked. Overlap leaked, in both orders. Swapping to an absolute
 * SIG_SETMASK of the saved value does not help either: it unblocks preempt_signo
 * while the preempt region is still live, which is worse. The save/restore idiom
 * is only conditionally correct, requiring strictly LIFO nesting. The leak above
 * is a property of two owners sharing one resource, not of any one call site,
 * and the derived mask is what makes a transition idempotent and independent of
 * the order overlapping regions open and close.
 *
 * A real target has no such problem: interrupt-disable is PRIMASK and
 * preempt-disable is BASEPRI or a software scheduler lock, so they are DISTINCT
 * resources with nothing to arbitrate. Only here does one mechanism, the signal
 * mask, stand in for both. So the tokens stay in the port contract for the targets
 * that want them, and are simply UNUSED here. Do not reintroduce a decision based
 * on one, and note they cannot even serve as a cross-check: asserting that a
 * restore's token matches what the depths call for fires on legitimate overlap.
