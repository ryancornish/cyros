/**
 * @file port_linux_common.hpp
 * @brief Contract shared by the linux ports (coop and preempt).
 *
 * NOT a port. This directory holds the parts of a linux port that do not depend
 * on how the port switches contexts, so each real port under src/port/linux/
 * compiles it alongside its own sources rather than linking a separate library.
 * Each port therefore gets its own object built with its own traits and flags,
 * which is what lets CYROS_PORT_DEBUG_MODE and friends stay per-port.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE
 * -----------------
 * Code that is identical between coop and preempt because it is about Linux or
 * the host CPU, not about scheduling: panic reporting, debugger hooks, CPU hints,
 * the measurement clock, and plain per-thread storage. If a candidate differs
 * between the two ports for any reason other than a stray comment, it does NOT
 * belong here.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT
 * -------------
 * Anything touching a port's own per-core state, context switching, signal
 * masking, or its time driver. Those are the actual differences between the two
 * ports and duplicating their shapes here would couple them.
 *
 * The port contract functions defined in port_linux_common.cpp are declared in
 * <cyros/port/port.h>, not here, because they are part of the kernel-facing C API
 * and must keep C linkage. Only the C++ internals appear below. A port that
 * includes this file must NOT also define the contract functions.
