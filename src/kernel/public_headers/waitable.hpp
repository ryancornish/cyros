/* ============================================================================
 * waitable - kernel base class for blockable objects
 *
 * Inherit from waitable to make your object parkable. The base class owns
 * a private wait_queue and exposes:
 *   - block()             : stateless park; wake on any signal (caller accepts
 *                           the possibility of missed events - see below)
 *   - block_until(pred)   : park until a caller-supplied predicate holds
 *   - wake_one/wake_all   : protected; for derived classes to signal waiters
 *   - is_satisfied(self)  : virtual; overridden by derived primitives so
 *                           block_on_any can poll them
 *
 * Block-on-any is provided as a free function (block_on_any) that is a
 * friend of waitable.
 *
 * Composition vs inheritance
 * --------------------------
 * Inherit waitable when your object IS something threads block ON
 * (mutex, semaphore, thread-termination, event, timer-source). Use plain
 * composition - an waitable member - when your object merely USES blocking
 * internally without being a wait target itself.
 *
 * The lost-wakeup problem and the two-phase block
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * A thread cannot simply "check, then park": between the check and the park,
 * another context may signal the condition, and the wakeup is lost. waitable
 * solves this with a two-phase block performed internally by block_until():
 *
 *   1. arm   : record intent to block, under the queue lock. Any signal
 *              AFTER this point is guaranteed to reach the caller.
 *   2. check : evaluate the predicate. If true, abandon the block.
 *   3. park  : commit to blocking. A signal that arrived since arming is
 *              honoured, not lost. Loops on spurious wakeup.
 *
 * The raw three-phase primitives are NOT exposed.
 *
 * Spurious wakeups
 * ----------------
 * A woken thread is NOT guaranteed that its condition holds: the resource may
 * have been consumed by a higher-priority waiter, or by a fresh caller racing
 * in, before the woken thread runs. block_until() and block_on_any() handle
 * this by re-checking and re-blocking transparently. This is intrinsic to all
 * blocking primitives (cf. the mandatory while-loop around pthread_cond_wait)
 * and is not a Cyros-specific cost.
 *
 * Barging
 * -------
 * waitable is BARGE-PERMITTING by design: a wake does not reserve the
 * resource for the woken thread, so a fresh thread may acquire it between
 * the wake and the woken thread running. This is cheap, high-throughput, and
 * sufficient for many primitives (counting semaphore, event, join). If your
 * primitive requires strict, barge-free, priority-fair handoff, release it
 * through wake_one_and_transfer, which commits ownership to the chosen
 * waiter under the queue lock. If it additionally requires priority
 * inheritance (typically a mutex that must bound priority inversion), derive
 * from pi_waitable below, which packages the ownership protocol and the
 * inheritance bookkeeping together.
 *
 * Concurrency & ISR safety
 * ------------------------
 * wake_one() and wake_all() are safe to call from ISR context. A wake from
 * an ISR (or any context that cannot synchronously switch) defers its
 * reschedule via the weak reschedule contract - see reschedule_policy. List
 * mutation is protected by a per-queue lock; the queue is safe under SMP
 * and against concurrent block()/wake() on different cores.

/* ============================================================================
 * pi_waitable - ownable waitable with priority inheritance
 *
 * The base for primitives that have a single owning thread at a time and must
 * bound priority inversion (typically a mutex). It packages three things:
 *
 *   1. The ownership protocol proven by wake_one_and_transfer: a CAS take on
 *      owner_id when free, recognition of ownership already transferred while
 *      parked, and a barge-free handover committed under the queue lock.
 *
 *   2. Donation: a thread about to park behind a live owner rings a priority
 *      recompute for that owner, so the owner runs at the urgency of its most
 *      urgent waiter.
 *
 *   3. Restore: release retires the resource from the owner's held list and
 *      recomputes the owner from remaining truth, so donations never outlive
 *      the contention that justified them.
 *
 * Lock ordering
 * ----------------------------
 * The recompute nests pi_lock -> queue lock, therefore nothing running under
 * a queue lock may take any pi_lock. This is why the handover commit only
 * writes this object's own atomics and the woken thread completes its own
 * held-list linkage in its next wait_condition poll, in its own context.
 *
 * Not ISR-safe: acquisition and release take the calling thread's pi_lock and
 * recompute, both of which assume thread context.
 *
 * A thread must not terminate while owning a pi_waitable ,
 * and a pi_waitable must not be destroyed while owned.
