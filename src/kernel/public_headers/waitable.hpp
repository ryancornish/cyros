    * @brief Best waiter urgency on this queue, which is what its holder inherits.

    * Fast path is one atomic load. top_priority caches the minimum BASE priority
    * of the waiters, and base never changes, so that cache has only immutable
    * inputs and can never go stale. No re-slotting, ever.
    *
    * The slow path exists because a waiter that itself HOLDS something can be
    * more urgent than its base: that is the transitive chain. Only such a waiter
    * can be, so the fold runs over the bridges alone rather than the whole queue,
    * and may_have_bridges is false for the overwhelming majority of queues.
    *
    * @param resource_owner The owner word of the resource this queue backs.
    *        Read UNDER the queue lock and excluded from the bridge fold: an
    *        acquirer is briefly both owner and armed waiter in its own queue
    *        (the window between the winning CAS and its disarm), and recursing
    *        into it from its own queue is a self-cycle that exhausts the depth
    *        budget and answers 0. Skipping the owner makes that cycle
    *        unrepresentable at every recursion depth rather than merely brief.
    *
    *        The read must happen inside the lock, not be passed in as a value.
    *        A handover commits the owner under this same lock after unlinking
    *        the chosen waiter, so an under-lock read is exactly consistent
    *        with the queue contents: a thread observed both armed and owning
    *        is the acquire-window self-cycle and nothing else. A value read
    *        before the lock can go stale against exactly that handover, and
    *        the ex-owner can re-arm as a legitimate bridge behind it, which
    *        the stale exclusion would then skip, an UNDER-report.
    *
    *        The lock-free CAS take is the one owner transition outside this
    *        lock, and racing it is UNREACHABLE rather than merely benign. A
    *        fold arrives at a queue only through
    *        base_mutex::urgency_contribution, whose sole caller walks a thread's
    *        held_slots, and a mutex is filed there only by claim_slot, called
    *        either after the CAS that made the
    *        owner or from the handover commit under this lock. So anything able
    *        to consult this queue already observes the owner word set. Stated
    *        as unreachable on purpose: calling it "the safe over-boost
    *        direction" would repeat the mistake this parameter exists to fix,
    *        since a fabricated 0 is unsafe for a RUNNING thread and the
    *        acquirer here is running. Principle 8.
    * @param depth Remaining recursion budget. A wait-for cycle means the
    *        application has deadlocked; the budget stops the kernel following it
    *        forever and the answer is then conservative rather than wrong.

/* ============================================================================
 * waitable - kernel base class for blockable objects
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Inherit from waitable to make your object something threads can block ON
 * (semaphore, event, thread-termination, a future alarm). The base owns a
 * private wait_queue and exposes to the derived class:
 *
 *   try_satisfy()           virtual. Attempt to satisfy the caller without
 *                           blocking, consuming the resource if that is what
 *                           satisfaction means. wait_on_any polls it between
 *                           arm and park, which is the two-phase block that
 *                           closes the lost-wakeup window. Runs in the calling
 *                           thread's context, so an implementation that needs
 *                           the caller's identity uses this_thread::id().
 *   wake_one / wake_all     signal waiters. ISR-safe.
 *   wake_one_and_transfer   barge-free handoff, see the protocol note below.
 *
 * Threads wait via this_thread::wait_on(w) or wait_on_any(w0, w1, ...), never
 * through methods on the waitable itself. Use composition instead of
 * inheritance when your object merely uses blocking internally without being a
 * wait target.
 *
 * Barging, and the transfer protocol
 * ----------------------------------
 * waitable is BARGE-PERMITTING by default: a wake does not reserve anything
 * for the woken thread, so a fresh caller may take the resource first and the
 * woken thread re-parks. That is cheap and right for counting semaphores,
 * events and joins.
 *
 * Barge-free handoff, where a release commits the resource to the chosen
 * waiter under the queue lock so nothing can interpose, is available through
 * wake_one_and_transfer plus a try_satisfy that recognises ownership by id,
 * plus renounce_if_assigned for the group-wait interaction. This CANNOT be
 * built outside the kernel from wake_one: choosing the best waiter and
 * committing to it must happen under the queue lock, which nothing else can
 * reach. That is why the surface exists here.
 *
 * STATUS: no in-tree primitive currently derives a transfer-shaped waitable.
 * The kernel mutex needs barge-free handoff WITH priority inheritance and gets
 * both from base_mutex, which composes the same wait_queue directly and is
 * deliberately not a waitable. This surface is the path for a barge-free
 * primitive WITHOUT inheritance (a strict-fairness semaphore, a mailbox that
 * hands its datum to exactly one waiter). test_transfer_waitables is its
 * conformance test and is what keeps the dual-satisfaction contract honest.
 *
 * Spurious wakeups
 * ----------------
 * A woken thread is not guaranteed its condition holds: the resource may have
 * been consumed before it runs. wait_on_any re-checks and re-parks
 * transparently, the same mandatory loop as around pthread_cond_wait.
