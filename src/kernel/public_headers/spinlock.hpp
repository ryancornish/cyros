/**
 * @brief Interrupt-masking spinlock for short critical sections
 *
 * Holding the lock is an interrupt-masking critical section on the calling
 * core: neither a thread switch nor an ISR can interleave with the holder.
 *
 * The cost of the guarantee is a latency contract: the system's worst-case
 * interrupt latency includes the longest hold plus any contention spin, so
 * sections must stay tiny (i.e. a few dozen instructions). For longer critical
 * sections, use a mutex.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   spinlock lock;
 *   lock.lock();
 *   // ... critical section ...
 *   lock.unlock();
 *
 * Or with RAII:
 *   spinlock lock;
 *   {
 *       spinlock_guard guard(lock);
 *       // ... critical section ...
 *   } // Automatically unlocked
