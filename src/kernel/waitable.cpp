/**
 * @file waitable.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of the waitable kernel base class.
 *
 * Lost-wakeup correctness rests on two cooperating mechanisms:
 *
 *  1. The two-phase block in this file: arm (link a wait_node into the
 *     queue under the queue lock, set the thread's state to blocked), then
 *     park (yield to the scheduler). The queue lock is released between
 *     arm and park.
 *
 *  2. The scheduler's tolerance of state==ready on entry to reschedule().
 *     A wake that arrives in the window between arm-unlock and park sees a
 *     properly-linked, blocked thread; it unlinks the node and sets
 *     state=ready. When the thread then yields, reschedule() sees
 *     state==ready and treats it as a rotation (re-enqueue, pick the next
 *     thread). No yield is "lost"; no wake is dropped.
 *
 * Block-on-any uses a SEPARATE wait_node per source, allocated on the
 * blocking thread's stack. A wait_node has exactly one 'next' pointer; it
 * cannot be in two intrusive lists at once. The TCB's embedded wait_node
 * serves single-wait blocks at zero extra cost; block_on_any pays N stack
 * nodes for N sources, with no heap and no pool.
