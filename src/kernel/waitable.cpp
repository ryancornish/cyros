/**
 * @file waitable.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of the waitable kernel base class.
 *
 * Lost-wakeup correctness rests on two cooperating mechanisms:
 *
 *  1. The two-phase block in this file: arm (link a wait_node into the
 *     queue under the queue lock, set the thread's state to blocked), then
 *     park (yield to the scheduler). The queue lock is released between
 *     arm and park.
 *
 *  2. The scheduler's tolerance of state==ready on entry to reschedule().
 *     A wake that arrives in the window between arm-unlock and park sees a
 *     properly-linked, blocked thread; it unlinks the node and sets
 *     state=ready. When the thread then yields, reschedule() sees
 *     state==ready and treats it as a rotation (re-enqueue, pick the next
 *     thread). No yield is "lost"; no wake is dropped.
 *
 * A wait_node has exactly one 'next' pointer, so it cannot be in two intrusive
 * lists at once, which is why waiting on several sources needs one node per
 * source. The nodes live in a wait_node_vector on the blocking thread's own
 * stack, so there is no heap and no pool. Every wait goes through wait_on_any,
 * including a wait on a single source.
