/**
 * @brief Select the next runnable thread for this core and switch to it.
 *
 * Sole arbiter of contested transitions. Runs on the owning core in the
 * current thread's context and reconciles that thread's own wish (its
 * disposition) against any wake that raced it.
 *
 * Design: state (position) and disposition (intent to block) are orthogonal.
 * A thread authors its own disposition, but this is the ONLY place committed
 * becomes blocked, so the block decision has a single arbiter even though the
 * wish is raised from thread context.
 *
 * Policy: drain_inbox() runs first and is the reconciler. A wake clears its
 * target's disposition as it readies it, so a wake landing on a thread that
 * already committed to blocking revokes that commit here. The wake wins and
 * the thread stays runnable rather than parking on a stale decision. A
 * rotation and the pick must therefore preserve a prepared disposition, so a
 * waiter preempted mid-wait comes back still intending to block and cannot be
 * stranded.
 *
 * Dispatch on the running thread:
 *      committed          -> park, not re-enqueued
 *      none / prepared    -> rotate, prepared preserved
 *      ready              -> already readied by drain, not re-enqueued
 *      terminated         -> exiting, not re-enqueued
 *      blocked / created  -> illegal on entry (asserted)
 *
 * Entry contract: called only by the owning core, current_thread non-null
 * and not enqueued. A blocked or created thread is never the running thread.
